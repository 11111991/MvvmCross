# MvvmCross

This project was born from:

- a branch of the MonoCross project, moving away from MVC and towards MVVM
- an extension project from www.Cirrious.com
- some ideas from MvvmLight
- some ideas from Phone7.Fx (OpenNetCF?)

# Current state

Both the Android and the WindowsPhone versions of this port are currently valid 
- only the CustomerManagement demo works in local mode - and that only works on Droid - WP7 has the wrong file code in there (not an Mvvm issue).

# Future direction

TBD... ?!
