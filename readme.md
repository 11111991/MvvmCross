# MvvmCross

This project was born from:

- a branch of the MonoCross project, moving away from MVC and towards MVVM
- an extension project from www.Cirrious.com
- some ideas from MvvmLight
- some ideas from Phone7.Fx (OpenNetCF?)


# Current state

Currently working:

- Android 
- Console
- WindowsPhone 
- CustomerManagement sample

Currently in progress:

- Touch

Currently not progressed:

- Book sample

Will not be progressed:

- WebKit - simply don't believe it belongs here


# Future direction

Under consideration
- Blendability
- Test integration
- Better Samples
- More cross platfrom services (location, contacts, sql, etc)
