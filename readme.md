# MonoCross Extensions

This project contains:

- a branch of the MonoCross project
- an extension project from www.Cirrious.com


# Current state

Only the WindowsPhone version of this port is currently valid - and only the CustomerManagement demo in local mode - and even that doesn't support saving to file.

# Future direction

I don't intend to continue this branch as is... some serious redesign is currently going on here - moving away from MVC and towards MVVM
 
# Licensing

MonoCross is redistributed and modified here under MIT - please see http://code.google.com/p/monocross/ for original details.
