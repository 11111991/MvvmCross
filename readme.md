# MvvmCross

This project was born from:

- a branch of the MonoCross project, moving away from MVC and towards MVVM
- an extension project from www.Cirrious.com
- some ideas from MvvmLight
- some ideas from Phone7.Fx (OpenNetCF?)

# Current state

Only the WindowsPhone version of this port is currently valid - and only the CustomerManagement demo in local mode - and even that doesn't support saving to file.

# Future direction

TBD... ?!
